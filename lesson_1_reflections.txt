A:By viewing the diff in the files, we could see 
all edited lines of code.  This restricted our
search for a bug to only a few lines. 

Q:How could having easy access to the entire 
history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term?
A: You could learn from your mistakes.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of 
manually choosing when to create a commit, like 
you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google Docs does?

A:  It is more labor intensive to manually choose.

Q:  Why do you think some version control systems, 
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file 
separately?
A:  For Git, the ability to simultaneously commit
multiple files allows for changes that are logically
connected, but span multiple files to be committed
simultaneously.  For something like Google Docs, where
each file tends to stand on its own, this sort of functionality
adds unwanted complexity.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view 
the history of files?
A:  You use git log to get id's of commits and see the purpose 
of the commit.  You can then use git diff to see the differences
in the files.

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to 
make changes that could break something?
A:  You do not worry about breaking things because you can always
revert back to a previous state.
