Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A:  It enables tracking of versions and details through hidden files on computer.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

A:  It provides a place to collect files that belong as part of one logical commit.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: You use the staging area to collect all the files modified for a logical change
and then you commit it.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?
A: Branches are great for maintaining different versions with very similar
functionality.  For example, I can imagine using branches to make different 
versions of my book.  They might include different chapters.

Q: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent 
it in the diagram the way we do?

A:  The result of merging is to accept the changes from two branches into one.
This allows changes to different parts of a program to be done concurrently.
It is represented to show that all commits can be traced backwards to a parent.
